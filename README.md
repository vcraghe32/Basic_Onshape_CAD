This base was pretty easy to make, onshape is easier and less glitchy than soldiworks so that helped.

I learned: How to navigate Onshape and that it's easier to put it full screen.

The mount was easy to make, I had no difficulties and it was helpful to see how I can make a part in different ways.

I learned: How to use features from other parts to create a part, and to use a linear pattern in a sketch.
