## Base

<img src="https://github.com/vcraghe32/Basic_Onshape_CAD/blob/master/folder_name/baseimage.png" width="450">
This base was pretty easy to make, onshape is easier and less glitchy than soldiworks so that helped.

I learned: How to navigate Onshape and that it's easier to put it full screen.

## Mount

The mount was easy to make, I had no difficulties and it was helpful to see how I can make a part in different ways.

I learned: How to use features from other parts to create a part, and to use a linear pattern in a sketch.

## Fork

The fork was fun to make, super simple.

I learned: How to do chamfers and fillets and how to mirror them

## Tire

It was really cool to use the revolve feature, and make a trapezoid.

I learned: How to use the revolve feature

## Wheel

It was fun to cut spokes, and I had trouble becuase I dimensioned something wrong and I couldn't undo it but I fixed it by doing it all over again.

I learned: How to use the revolve feature

It was really helpful to use the "Use" feature becuase the whole thing it took less time than I thought. It was cool to see that even the tiny parts add to the design.

I learned: How to use the "Use" feature.

## Subassembly - Wheel and Axle

<img src="https://github.com/vcraghe32/Basic_Onshape_CAD/blob/master/folder_name/wheelandaxleimage.png" width="450">
This was 100x easier to mate than in Soldiworks, becuase I didn't have to use coincident mates three times or use concentric, and also the revolve mate is super awesome. I loved watching the animation of my axle.

I learned: How to mate parts in onshape

## Subassembly - FINAL assembly

This one took a long time to make, but it was wayyyy easier to assemble than solidworks. I loved how easy it was to just place the nuts and bolts in.

I learned: How to insert parts and hardware into an assembly and mate them.
